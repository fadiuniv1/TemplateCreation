# TemplateCreation
Image Template Creator
This project allows users to create templates with custom information, photos, and logos. The templates are created using the Python library PIL (Pillow) and the user interface is built with tkinter.

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites
You will need to have Python and pip installed on your machine. You can check if you have them by running the following commands in your command line:
```
  python --version
  pip --version
  ```
# Installing
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```
  git clone https://github.com/fadiuniv1/image-template-creator.git
```
# Navigate to the project directory:

# Install the required packages:
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Running the program
